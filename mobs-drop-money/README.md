## Mobs Drop Money

This set of scripts makes hostile mobs drop [Good Ol' Currency](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/good-ol-currency) money based on their maximum health. There are two versions of this script:

* Basic - Just drops money
* Advanced - Has an enchantment to increase the amount of money dropped

Both versions require:

* [Good Ol' Currency](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/good-ol-currency)
* [CraftTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker)
* [CraftTweaker Utils](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker-utils)

In addition, the advanced version requires [ContentTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/contenttweaker) for the enchantment.

### Installation

Simply select the version you want and drop all .zs files in the respective folder (basic or advanced) into *modpack-install-path*/scripts. If you're using the advanced version, put the en_us.lang file into *modpack-install-path*/resources/contenttweaker/lang. I will accept translations for the enchantment in pull requests.
